# joint-mortality
Code to reproduce figures from Dharamshi, Alexander, Winant, and Barbieri (2024), which will appear in Demographic Research.

The "Simulation study" folder contains the code to reproduce the results in Section 3.4. The folder contains the "simulations.R" script to run the simulations, "joint_model_multi.stan" which contains the Stan model, and "pcs.rda" which contains the principal components used. The Data analysis folder contains the code used for Section 4. As discussed in the paper, mortality data is highly sensitive and cannot be shared publicly. We have constructed a mock data set to illustrate the use of the code. The file "READMEWrapperScriptNotes20231121.pdf" provides detailed instructions.

This study was made possible by an award from the Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging (National Institute on Aging grant P30-AG012839) at the University of California, Berkeley. However, any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors alone and do not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institute on Aging.
